We encourage people to play in our sandbox. We want our players and fans to
share the game with their friends, write fan fiction, create websites for
their campaigns, post their house rules online, publish netbooks based on
their personalized settings, create crossover systems for running Eclipse
Phase using other published (or home-brewed) rules sets, or even mesh Eclipse
Phase with other favored crossover worlds. To this end, we've published the
Eclipse Phase RPG under a Creative Commons license. Details on how this
license works, and any exceptions that apply, are noted below.
